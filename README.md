# Stock-Market-GUI-Java
This is a stock market simulator made for a faculty project which uses CURL to get current data from yahoo.finance about stocks and simulates
buying/selling stocks in real time. Improved in Java with GUI.

I included my dll, as well as CURL dll, so the project doesn't have any other dependencies and can be compiled.
CURL is open source software,  and it is allowed to freely use and redistribute it.
